	<section>
		<p>
			This is a limited (but growing) collection of notes and resources relating
			to my somewhat limited (15 year) former career as an instructor of
			introductory engineering courses for civil engineering technologists in a
			two-year diploma program(me) in Canada.
		</p>
		<p>
			And some other oddball (though conceivably educational) material that has
			caught my interest along the way. (Warning: I am a math nerd.)
		</p>
		<p>Check back occasionally: this collection may grow on you.</p>
		<p>
			Please email

			<code>error/typo</code>
			in the subject field, if or (more likely) when you stumble across typos and/or
			inaccuracies.

			This site is currently being rebuilt. Navigation links with <s>strikethrough</s>
			text indicate material that is planned but has not yet been added to the site.
		</p>
		<p>
			As material is added, it is listed (and linked) below. This may save you
			time exploring new content:

		<ul>
			<li>
				A <a href="/statics/vis/conc/">visualisation</a> illustrating the effect
				of a concentrated load applied to a simply supported beam. Added 11th December,
				2021.
			</li>
			<li>
				A <a href="/statics/vis/dist/">visualisation</a> illustrating the effect
				of a distributed load applied to a simply supported beam. Added 12th December,
				2021.
			</li>
			<li>
				A method-of-joints <a href="/statics/vis/moj/">visualisation</a>,
				illustrating forces in the truss members of a bridge as a truck crosses
				the bridge. Super cool, if I say so myself. Added 13th December, 2021.
